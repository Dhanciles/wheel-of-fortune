**Game Time - Wheel of Fortune**

*Mod 2 - 1808*

**Instructions**

Install the project and open it in a browser.

Enter your name and the names of two of your friends and click the start button. The game begins with Player 1's turn. Player 1 has the option to spin, guess the puzzle, or buy a vowel. At the beginning of the game, it's best to spin. Click the 'Spin the Wheel!' button and you will recieve a dollar value, 'Lose a Turn', or 'Bankrupt'. If you lose a turn or go bankrupt, your turn is over and it will be the next player's turn. Otherwise you will receive a dollar value. You can now guess a letter. If that letter is present in the puzzle at least once, all of the matching letters will appear on the board and you will recieve points equal to the dollar value for each time the letter appears. It will then be your turn again, and you can again spin the wheel, guess the puzzle, or buy a vowel. If your letter is not present in the puzzle, your turn will end. If a player chooses to buy a vowel, $100 will be subtracted from his/her round score and the vowel buttons will become available. The player can then guess a vowel just like any other letter. If the player chooses to solve the puzzle and gets it correct, the complete puzzle will display on the board and the player's current score will be added to their total score. Other players' scores will not carry over, and the round is over. A new round will begin with a new, more difficult puzzle and more money at stake. If the guess is incorrect, the player's turn is over. A game consists of 4 rounds, after which the player with the highest total score will be able to play a bonus round. That player wins the game!
